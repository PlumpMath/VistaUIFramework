# What is VistaUIFramework
VistaUI is a framework based on WinForms and .NET Framework for developing .NET Applications using Vista and 7 features, like arrow-splitted buttons, command links, vista-style controls and etc.

## No P/Invoke or WinAPI knowledge required
Stop trying to learn Windows API to learn p/invoke to make vista controls. Let VistaUI do the work for you.

## Windows Vista and later features for WinForms
.NET Framework and Windows Forms does not replace Windows API at 100%, not even the visual styles. The lack of features is one of the biggest cons. Get the most out of Windows by using VistaUIFramework instead of learning P/Invoke.

## The Windows Vista and 7 look into your program
Make your application look like a Windows Vista/7 program. You won't stop looking at your program.

## Don't spend your time developing custom controls
Developing custom controls like `CommandLink`, `SplitButton` or `ProgressBar` delays the release date of any project. Simply use VistaUIFramework and start developing.
